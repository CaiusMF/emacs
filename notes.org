* Learning Emacs

** Key meanings

C = Ctrl key
M = Meta key (Alt, Option keys)
s = Super key (linux, windows, command keys)
S = Shift key

** Key bindings

*** Movement 

C-p   = prev line
C-n   = next line
C-b   = prev character
C-f   = next character
M-f   = forward word
M-b   = backward word
M->   = end of buffer
M-<   = begining of buffer
C-v   = scroll up
M-v   = scroll down
C-M-p = backward out of one level of parantheses
C-M-n = forward across one group of parantheses

*** Buffers

C-x right = next buffer
C-x left  = prev buffer
C-M-[     = prev buffer
C-M-]     = next buffer
C-x C-s   = save buffer
C-x x r	  = rename-buffer
C-x k	  = kill buffer (specify)
s-k       = kill current buffer
C-M-j	  = counsel switch buffer (custom map)

*** Text manipulation

C-k = cut/kill line
C-w = cut/kill region
C-y = paste/yank
C-/ = undo
C-? = redo
M-w = copy/save to kill ring
M-y = cycle kill ring

*** Search

C-s   = forward search
C-r   = reverse search
M-s . = search symbol under cursor

*** Help

C-h v = describe variable (prompt list)
C-h f = describe function (prompt list)
C-h o = describe symbol (best of both worlds) (prompt list)
      * if called with cursor on var/func/symbol, will default to it
C-h b = describe bindings
C-h k = describe key (prompt)

*** Other

C-x C-e	        = eval last expression
M-x eval-buffer = eval whole buffer
M-x M-x         = eval region (requires counsel)
s-'             = next window

*** Dired

C-x d   = to enter dired mode
C-x C-j = jump to dired buffer corresponding to current buff
C-o     = display file/folder in other window (~no focus~)
o       = visit file/folder in other window (~focus~)
h       = for help (describe-mode)
j       = for jumping to file

dired-jump

  
* Cool themes

 + dark:
   - gruvbox
   - dracula
   - material
   - palenight
   - peacock
   - snazzy
 + light:
   - acario-light
   - solarized-light
   - tsdh-light

* Info

 + doing 'eval-buffer' on config code multiple times can multiply hooks

 + text selection: instead of 'S-C-a' or 'S-C-e' selection, combine 'C-SPC' with
   'C-a' or 'C-e'

 + M-o in counsel-M-x = manipulate selected function

 + 'list-packages' refreshes the package repos (useful if 'use-package'
   doesn't find a package)

 + projectile only sees folders as projects if they are repos (git, mercurial, etc)
   or marked 

 + 'counsel-projectile-rg' = search the current project with rg

   - C-c C-o = puts the search into a new buffer which is persistent and
       can be browsed (helpful for finding things in a project)

 + counsel-esh-history = search eshell command history

* TODO 
 - [ ] find select whole line from whatever current position in said line
   
 - [ ] how to rename current buffer
   
 - [ ] python color inconsistencies (doom-themes?)
   
 - [ ] see in future if you need switch-buffer-other-window
   
 - [ ] terminal spawn/kill shortcut
   
 - [ ] see 'general' package for cleaner key binding definitions
   - see System Crafters' Emacs From Scratch #3
   - can add other prefixes like 'C-SPACE'
     
 - [ ] check 'auto-fill-mode' for txt files
   
 - [ ] need: scroll to not move cursor?
   
 - [ ] read on/experiment:
   - multiple cursors
     
 - [ ] investigate new types of newline
   
 - [ ] new forms of selection
   - word
   - whole function
     
 - [-] check out [[orgmode.org]] (read manual)

 - [X] undo/redo

 - [ ] see end of 'Emacs From Scratch #5 - Org Mode Basics' for:

   + text wrapping

   + visual fill mode (center text on screen)

   + different font sizes for different text types (headers, text, lists, etc)

 - [ ] version control for emacs config (ubuntu, manjaro, macos) (with magit?)

 - [ ] add friends and family birthdays in org mode agenda (on repeat)

 - [ ] find way to jump back to where you previously were in a buffer

 - [ ] search symbol (M-s .) and mark them (multiple lines)

 - [ ] C-SPC select from end-of-line to start-of-first-word not start-of-line
